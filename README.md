# socket_chat
The project is about a chat service implemented using the Linux Sockets interface in C. It's composed by two applications, a server and a client.

## Usage
Both server and client are C applications that run on Linux terminal. The communication between clients and server is based in several commands.

To run server aplication you must execute the next two commands:
   1- '$ gcc server.c -o server'
   2- '$ ./server'

To run a client you just need to execute the makefile by executing: '$ make'. If you get some error after executing this command, you must run the next two commands:
    1- '$ gcc -pthread -no-pie client.c terminal.o -lncurses -o client'
    2- '$ ./client'
